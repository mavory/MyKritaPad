# My Journal

This is my write-up of how I made my first PCB project.

## Timeline

I started on Friday, October 28th. That day I saw that I could make my own mini keyboard, I registered and downloaded the programs. Then I opened KiCad and said to myself that I would never do it (it was like flying a plane for the first time). Well, I had to overcome myself and started creating with it. At first it was terrible, but somehow I got through it. I tried to do different options 4x3, 5x3,... I did it all afternoon and then the whole evening. At midnight I told myself that I would sleep and continue in the morning.

I got up in the morning and started working on the HackPad right away, I told myself that I could create a 3x3 with 2 encoders and I started redoing it all. It took me the whole morning, but unfortunately I got sick in the afternoon of October 29th and couldn't do anything at all, but on November 30th I got over myself and continued working. I just fine-tuned the schematic and started making a PCB design. That took me a whole day because I didn't know how to do it. Then I created it and found out that it exceeded 100x100... So I started over again and worked on it until the evening.

On the morning of December 1st, I woke up early to finish it. In the morning, I finished the PCB design, which took me about 3 hours. Before lunch, I started making a 3D model in Fusion, I didn't know how it worked at all, so I was a little confused. But I started modeling the lower part, which took me a long time. I didn't know how to deal with lengths at all, but I somehow managed it. That same day, I made the upper part, but I had more trouble with it. In the evening, I finished the GitHub repo and filmware, so it took me about 10 hours of work in total. Then I just submitted the project and waited for approval!

On December 2nd, I realized that a few things didn't fit, so I had to redo it a bit. That probably took me over 5 hours of work.

On December 3rd I was finishing and exporting the files I was going to print and also creating a folder for the PCB. It took me about 3 hours in total. I also had to further edit the 3D models in the slicer to get it right. That same day I printed the bottom case, you can see it here:

------------------

4. 12. I continued printing and forgot to create a knob for the encoder, so I finished it and printed it, it took me about 2 hours in total.

On 5. 12. I was looking for a solder that I could buy from my grand, I found it and bought it too. I then created an order on JLCPCB. I managed to do everything in about an hour.

6. 12. I unexpectedly received an email from our state post office asking me to fill out customs information, it was my first time doing it so I didn't know how to do it, but I managed to do it. I also redid filmware that day so my pad could do more things! I edited the 3D parts and removed the unevenness. I spent about 4 hours on it that day.

## So how much time did I spend on that?

A lot. (Just kidding. like I said, it was my first time doing this, so about  8 days 😭)

## My worst hangups

- I didn't even know how to export anything at all at first...
- MAINLY, how the programs work
- Connecting the PCB so it didn't look like spaghetti (but I still managed to make it)
- The worst part: learning how to operate Fusion (I've never used it and it annoyed me that I couldn't just move the mouse and look at the 3d model, but then I found out that I could 😭)

Yes, this is my work... (I didn't even know what I was doing - that's the first day I've done it, so Friday 11/28)

Here I was thinking I would never learn.
