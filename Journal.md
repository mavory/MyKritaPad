# My Journal

This is my write-up of how I made my first PCB project.

## Timeline

I started on Friday, October 28th. That day I saw that I could make my own mini keyboard, I registered and downloaded the programs. Then I opened KiCad and told myself that I would never do it (it was like flying a plane for the first time). Well, I had to overcome myself and started creating with it. At first it was terrible, but somehow I got over it.

Unfortunately, on October 29th I got sick and couldn't do anything at all, but on November 30th I overcame myself and started creating the first designs for my KritaPad. When I created it with it, I moved to Fusion, which I also looked into, what it was... Somehow I did it, even though I don't want to think about it.

Then on December 1st I overcame myself and spent the whole day at the computer to finish it. In the evening I finished and submitted the project.

## So how much time did I spend on that?

A lot. (Just kidding. like I said, it was my first time doing this, so about 3 days of work - with breaks 💀)

## My worst hangups

- I didn't even know how to export anything at all at first...
- MAINLY, how the programs work
- Connecting the PCB so it didn't look like spaghetti (but I still managed to make it)
- The worst part: learning how to operate Fusion (I've never used it and it annoyed me that I couldn't just move the mouse and look at the 3d model, but then I found out that I could 😭)

Yes, this is my work... (I didn't even know what I was doing - that's the first day I've done it, so Friday 11/28)

Here I was thinking I would never learn.
